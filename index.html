    <p>I’m a lifelong learner and I'm not afraid of challenges. I listen ideas, I ask questions, I facilitate discussions and I identify solutions. As a Project Manager, I believe that improving people’s relationships with each other amplifies their ability to overcome challenges; As a Professional Translator, I value the role of communications in every human interaction.</p>
    <p>My last work experience has been very rewarding. I’ve worked as an English to Spanish translator, as an instructional designer and as a project manager in software development projects, position I plan on enjoying until I find new opportunities to continue learning. I use tools like Trello, Jira, Adobe XD and GanttProject. I possess excellent time management skills, great ability to work under pressure and patience to solve conflicts.</p>
